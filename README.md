### **Stripe Connect Account Types Simplified**

When deciding between Stripe Connect account types, consider these three options: **Standard, Express, and Custom**. Here’s a simple breakdown:

---

### **1. Standard Accounts**
- **For whom?** Experienced online business owners.
- **Dashboard:** Full Stripe dashboard access.
- **Integration Effort:** Low (Stripe handles most things).
- **Fraud/Dispute Liability:** Users (e.g., business owners) handle their own disputes.
- **Onboarding:** Stripe-hosted, easy setup.

**Real-world analogy:** Think of it as renting an office in a shared workspace. You have your tools and space, but you’re responsible for running your operations.

---

### **2. Express Accounts**
- **For whom?** Any user, including less tech-savvy ones.
- **Dashboard:** Simplified dashboard.
- **Integration Effort:** Low to moderate.
- **Fraud/Dispute Liability:** You, the platform, handle disputes.
- **Onboarding:** Stripe-hosted onboarding simplifies user setup.

**Real-world analogy:** Imagine a franchise where the parent company (you) takes care of the back-end stuff (disputes, compliance), so franchisees (users) just focus on their core tasks.

### **3. Custom Accounts**
- **For whom?** Platforms with extensive dev resources.
- **Dashboard:** None (you must build it from scratch).
- **Integration Effort:** High (requires engineering investment).
- **Fraud/Dispute Liability:** You manage everything.
- **Onboarding:** Fully customizable, but you’re responsible for compliance and upkeep.

**Real-world analogy:** Building your own restaurant from the ground up. You control everything, but it’s a lot of work.

### **Key Factors to Decide**
1. **Your Users’ Experience:**
   - Experienced business owners → **Standard**.
   - Broad audience (non-tech-savvy) → **Express**.
2. **Dev Resources:**
   - Limited → Avoid **Custom**.
   - Plenty → Consider **Custom** for full control.
3. **Who Handles Disputes?**
   - User → **Standard**.
   - You → **Express** or **Custom**.

### **Quick Recommendation**
- **Small Platforms/Startups:** Use **Express** for simplicity and broad usability.
- **Large Platforms/Marketplaces:** Choose **Custom** only if you have the resources.

**Real-world decision flowchart analogy:**  
Think of choosing a car:
- **Standard** = Renting (minimal effort).  
- **Express** = Leasing (shared responsibility).  
- **Custom** = Building your own car (full control, but resource-intensive).
